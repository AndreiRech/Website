# **Personal Website**

This project was created by me to serve as my **personal website** and was built to showcase a little more about me and my skills.

## **Technologies**

The website was created using:

- [React](https://react.dev/) | utilized for its efficient component-based architecture
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | chosen for its strong typing system that enhances code reliability
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) | utilized for its ability to create maintainable and scalable stylesheets
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) | chosen as the primary design tool for its comprehensive design features
- [Github](https://github.com/) | utilized as my version control system to manage code changes efficiently

*quick note: You can find references to all of them by clicking on the respective links.*
